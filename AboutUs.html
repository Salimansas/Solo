					<h2>Web Apps</h2>
					<p>From the very beginning of <b> Laravel,</b> I've had this idea that all people want to feel like
						they are part of something. It's a natural <strong> Human</strong> instinct to want to belong
						and be accepted into a group of other like-minded people <i> So,</i> By injecting personality
						into a web framework and being really active with the community<em>emphasized</em>.
						that type of feeling can grow in the community. <sub>_ Taylor Otwell, Product and Support
							interview</sub>
						<a href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x"></a>laravel</p>
					<hr />

					<h2>Mobile Apps</h2>
					<p>There are two main types of mobile apps: native apps, developed specifically for a particular
						platform, and hybrid apps, built using web technologies and run on multiple platforms. The
						process of developing a mobile app involves several steps, including ideation, design,
						development, testing, and deployment, and requires a deep understanding of the platform, user
						experience, and app architecture. Mobile apps have greatly changed the way we interact with
						technology and are used by billions of people worldwide..</p>
					<hr />

					<h2>Industrial Design</h2>
					<p>Industrial design is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the design and development of
						products and systems for the manufacturing industry. It combines elements of engineering,
						ergonomics, aesthetics, and human-centered design to create functional and visually appealing
						products.

						The goal of industrial design is to create products that meet the needs and expectations of
						users while also being efficient to manufacture and easy to use. This involves conducting
						research, prototyping, testing, and refining designs to ensure that the final product is both
						functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
					<hr />


					<h2>Feature Integration</h2>
					<p>Feature integration refers to the process of adding new features or functionality to an existing
						product or system. The goal of feature integration is to enhance the user experience and provide
						additional value to the end-user.

						In software development, feature integration can involve adding new features to an existing
						software application or integrating with external systems to provide new functionality. This can
						involve adding new functionalities such as additional payment options, enhanced security
						features, or new user interface elements.</p>
